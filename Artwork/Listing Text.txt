Do you find yourself buying mostly the same grocery items each time you shop? Do you want to quickly decide how many of each item you need to buy? Do you want to set up your lists so that the order of the items exactly matches your kitchen when you making the list and exactly matches the store when you are shopping? Then this app is for you.

I created this app for personal use and hope you find it helpful too.
