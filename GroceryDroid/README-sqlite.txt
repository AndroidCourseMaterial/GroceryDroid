On 2015 Oct 24, I created a branch for sqlite for historical purposes. It probably should be a tag, but branches are so easy to The status of the project:

Works fine for pre-Material themes. 
	Uses SQLite for persistence.
	Uses ActionBarSherlock for action bar.
	Uses ListViews for items
	
I am cutting over to master to update each of these:
	Firebase for persistence so I can use auth and multiple devices
	Material theme including the Floating Action Button and AppBar
	RecyclerView for efficiency and to gain practice with it.
